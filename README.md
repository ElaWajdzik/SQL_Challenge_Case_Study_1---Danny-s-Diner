## Business Case
Danny seriously loves Japanese food so at the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.

Danny‚Äôs Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but has no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.

## Relationship Diagram

Additionally, in the code, I created constraints related to primary and foreign keys. The information about the constraints comes from the relationship diagram.

````sql
ALTER TABLE members
ALTER COLUMN customer_id VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE members
ADD CONSTRAINT members_customer_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);

ALTER TABLE menu
ALTER COLUMN product_id INT NOT NULL;

ALTER TABLE menu
ADD CONSTRAINT menu_product_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

ALTER TABLE sales
ADD CONSTRAINT sales_product_id_fk 
FOREIGN KEY(product_id) REFERENCES menu(product_id);

--I can't create a foreign key constraint between members.customer_id and sales.customer_id because not every customer is also a member
````
